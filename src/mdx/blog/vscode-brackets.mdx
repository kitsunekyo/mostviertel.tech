> Do you use some extension to colorize brackets? You don't need to. VSCode has some powerful settings built in.

## Colorized Brackets

By default all brackets are displayed in the same color, and you can't really tell which bracket closes wich.

To enable the setting, open your vscode settings (with <kbd>CTRL + SHIFT + P</kbd>) and go to _Preferences: Open Settings (UI)_
Search for "Bracket Pair" and enable the setting below.

Now your brackets will be rendered in matching colors, so you can quickly see cohesive brackets.

## Bracket Guides

But we dont have to stop there. When we're in a deeply nested structure, its rather hard to find the parent brackets.

Open the same settings page back up again, and set "Show Bracket Guides" to `active`. You can have both vertical and horizontal Guides.

In your javascript code, you will now see a vertical line, indicating in which bracket block you currently are with your cursor (yellow in the screenshot).
