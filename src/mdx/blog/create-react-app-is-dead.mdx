The product I currently work on at work is using ejected create react app v4 as its base.
While this served the team, that initially started the project well, it no longer works for us,
and we're currently evaluating other options.

## our issues with create react app

### its unmaintained

one of the biggest issues is that create react app does not have anyone working on it properly since 2021. there's a few people that occasionally do some minor updates, but nobody wants to be an active maintainer.

- https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/discussions/11768

we ran into a major issue with CRA5 and tailwindcss, and I created a fix PR for it. its a single line hotfix, but it hasn't been reviewed since Jan 2022. (thats over 6 months now)

### customization is tricky

create react app is opinionated as hell, and I would argue a lot of the opinions are bad too.

for example installing tailwind required CRACO, or ejecting up until CRA5

> CRACO is a wrapper around cra that has its very own set if issues

### stable, it is not

no matter which create-react-app version you pick. whether its ejected or not. as your app grows, you will most likely run into compatibility issues, slow build speeds or generally broken tooling.

if you've ever ejected, you know how much nonsense is packed up in create react app. its mostly stuff that was once useful. but our tools have evolved since then and a lot of these things are no longer needed, or other tools simply do it better with less config.

### client side only rendering is most likely not what you want

one possible issue with create react app is the rendering flow itself. when a user loads your app, they will first see an empty screen, until all javascript is executed and run. this isnt the greatest UX and also really horrible for your SEO.

we got really easy ways to provide SSR, SSG, and ISR with frameworks like nextjs, remix, astro and many others. so if SEO is of any concern, client side rendering is a nono.

### people are starting to move on

a lot of content creators and oss people have recently started to actively discourage people from using create react app.

## alternatives to create react app

so what should we use instead?

### vitejs

i've already hinted at the new frameworks, but the closest thing we can have to create react app is [https://vitejs.dev/](https://vitejs.dev/)

vite gives use the same clientside rendering flow that we get from create react app. but its way faster through esbuild, and allows customization through an extensive and active plugin ecosystem.

### nextjs

while react is just a library, nextjs turns it into a full blown framework a la angular. (but without all the shitty parts)

when building a production grade app, nextjs will give you pretty much everything you might need. it comes with a built in router, a backend for frontend solution with api routes and a blazingly fast build system. the deployment story is also most likely the smoothest one out there, thanks to vercel.

you can pick whether you want SSR or SSG on a per-route-basis. so you can really finetune your application to the last detail.

### remix, astro and the others

we're blessed with options in react world. i havent tried any of these options yet. so i dont feel comfortable commenting on them.

## what now?

for any greenfield project, i'm 100% sold on nextjs. for any client-side only, or brownfield projects vite looks immensely promising, thanks to its simplicity.

when it comes to our product, we dont want to move off `react-router` yet and rewrite all our views in nextjs' file router. so we're trying to migrate to vite for now, but its not as easy as we've hoped. i'll write another post going into details about all the hurdles we've hit when migrating to vite.
