title: automatically set git upstream branch

After creating a new branch with `git switch -c mybranch` you cant immediately push to a remote.
If you try to do that, git will yell at you, telling you you need to configure an upstream branch.
ie. tell git what remote branch you want to push to from this local one.

To automatically infer the upstram branch without the manual step, configure `push.default`. [checkout the official docs](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-pushdefault) to learn more.

```bash
git config --global push.default current
```

When you do a `git push` now, git will automatically push to a remote with exactly the same name as your local branch.
