# Migrating from PlanetScale to Neon.tech

Following PlanetScale's [recent announcement](https://planetscale.com/blog/planetscale-forever) about discontinuing their free plan, like many others, I found myself reevaluating other options. As a developer who heavily relied on PlanetScale's services for my hobby projects, this news initially left me disheartened. However, after exploring alternative platforms, I stumbled upon Neon, which offers a nice free tier for their postgres hosting. In this blog post, I'll walk you through my personal experience of transitioning from PlanetScale to Neon.tech.

> I've picked [neon.tech](https://neon.tech/pricing), because they have a free tier, and their "Launch" plan currently starts at $19, which is a bit more reasonable for hobby projects that need to scale up. Another option is [CockroachDb](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/pricing/#).

## Connection strings

Get your planetscale connection strings either from your apps .env or create a new password in the planetscale dashboard.

**Planetscale**

```
mysql://<USER>:<PASSWORD>@aws.connect.psdb.cloud/mydb?sslaccept=strict
```

**Neon**

If you dont have an account yet, sign up on neon.tech and create your database. If possible, use the same database name that you used on planetscale.

```
postgresql://<USER>:<PASSWORD>@ep-super-paper-12345.eu-central-1.aws.neon.tech/mydb?sslmode=require
```

## Install pgloader

[GitHub - dimitri/pgloader: Migrate to PostgreSQL in a single command!](https://github.com/dimitri/pgloader)

Both Installing pgloader via `brew` on my m1 mac and `apt install` did not work for me on Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS. So I had to build `pgloader` from source.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dimitri/pgloader.git
apt-get install sbcl unzip libsqlite3-dev make curl gawk freetds-dev libzip-dev
cd pgloader
make pgloader
./build/bin/pgloader --version
```

## Create a pgloader config file

**Prepare neon connectionstring for pgloader**

For pgloader we have to use a slightly changed connection string for our target database on neon.  
Instead of `user:password@...` we should use `user:endpoint=<ENDPOINT>;password@...`

```
postgresql://<USER>:endpoint=ep-super-paper-12345;<PASSWORD>@ep-super-paper-12345.eu-central-1.aws.neon.tech/mydb?sslmode=require
```

**Prepare planetscale connectionstring for pgloader**

pgloader also has different query params for the connection string. Change `?sslmode=require`, to `?sslaccept=strict` in your planetscale connection string.

```
mysql://<USER>:<PASSWORD>@aws.connect.psdb.cloud/mydb?sslmode=require
```

I have two branches on planetscale, main and dev. For my main branch I created a file `config-main.load` with the following content.

```load
load database
	from mysql://<USER>:<PASSWORD>@aws.connect.psdb.cloud/mydb?sslmode=require
	into postgresql://<USER>:endpoint=ep-super-paper-12345;<PASSWORD>@ep-super-paper-12345.eu-central-1.aws.neon.tech/mydb?sslmode=require
	with quote identifiers, include drop, create tables, create indexes
	alter schema 'mydb' rename to 'public'
;
```

> make sure your file ends with a semicolon `;`

Repeat this for your other branches. For my dev branch I created a file `config-dev.load` with the connection strings for my dev branches.

**Note**

`with quote identifiers, include drop, create tables, create indexes` makes our migration a lot easier. `quote identifiers` preservers the case of the original column and table names. One of my tables is for example named `PasswordResetToken` in prisma. It is also named like that in planetscale, and the columns on it are for example named in camelCase like `userId`. The other flags are optional.

Not using `with quote identifiers` will change all table and column names to lowercase, which would require changes in our prisma schema.

## Migrate the data

Now we can migrate the data from planetscale to neon, by using `pgloader` with our config file.

Watch out! This drops all existing data in your target tables. So make sure your target is correct and back up any existing data on your neon db.

```bash
~/code/pgloader/build/bin/pgloader config-main.load
```

## Check data after migration

Go to the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech/), select the branch we migrated, and look through the data.

## Update `prisma.schema`

Thanks to our `with quote identifiers` migration, we dont have to set any `@@map` mappings for the table names. The only thing we have to change is the `provider`

```prisma
datasource db {
	provider = "postgressql"
	url = env("DATABASE_URL")
	relationMode = "prisma"
}
```

## Update the connection string in your app

Update your `.env.local` or `.env` with the new connection string from neon.

```.env
DATABASE_URL='postgresql://<USER>:endpoint=ep-super-paper-12345;<PASSWORD>@ep-super-paper-12345.eu-central-1.aws.neon.tech/mydb?sslmode=require'
```

Don't forget to update your connection string in your CI pipelines (github secrets or similar) too, once you've migrated the data.

## Final words

For my commercial projects I will continue to use planetscale, as I really like their services. But the pricetag of $39 per months for their cheapest hobby plan just does not work for my non profit and hobby projects.
