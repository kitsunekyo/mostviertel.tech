What if you already have a personal github account for your sideprojects and open source work, but your employer requires you to have a separate account for your work projects?

If you've worked with github before you will most likely already have an ssh key file named `~/.ssh/id_rsa` and a public key file `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`. This key is automatically used when pushing and pulling to and from github, if you clone it with the ssh url like `git@github.com:mycompany/my-repo.git`.

But if you try to add the same ssh key to both your personal AND your company account, github with throw an error, saying you cant use your key multiple times. So what can we do?

First create a new ssh-key for your organization.

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "name@company.org"
```

When prompted, give it a custom name like `id_rsa_company`.

Add the contents of the `.pub` file to your company github profile (Settings > SSH > Add), then add the new identity to your ssh-agent

```bash
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_company
```

Now create a `.ssh/config` file in your home directory, and add the following lines:

```
Host github.com
    HostName github.com
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    IdentitiesOnly yes

# If my company github organization is called mycompany
Host github.com-mycompany
    HostName github.com
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_company
    IdentitiesOnly yes
```

Whenever we `clone`, `push`, or `pull` with these hosts (like github.com-mycompany), our terminal will use the correct ssh key.

All you need to do now is amend the remote url to use the correct hostname. We can use some domain trickery for this.

If your company repo url normally looks like this `git@github.com:mycompany/my-repo.git` we just need to replace the `github.com` with `github.com-mycompany`. It will resolve just fine, and the correct ssh key will be used automagically.

To update the remote url, you can use the `git remote set-url` command.

```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com-mycompany:mycompany/my-repo.git
```

To make sure you commit with the right email / username set your user config to the correct email / username.

```bash
# in the company repo
git config user.email "user@company.org"
git config user.name "Company User"
```

You can now safely push and pull from your company repo, and your personal repos without any password prompts, and work with two different accounts.
