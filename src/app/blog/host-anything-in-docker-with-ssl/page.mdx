If you have a lot of applications that you want to host in docker, you can use this article to get SSL for free.
You additionally separate all your containerized apps nicely with different, automatically managed subdomains.

> This is especially useful if you for example have a VPS (virtual private server) that runs docker, and you want to use it to deploy all your applications, via a single host.

We're gonna use two handy docker containers for that. `nginx-proxy` and `letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion` check our their documentation for more info about how you can customize them further.

First we want to start up `nginx-proxy`

```bash
docker run --detach \
  --name nginx-proxy \
  --publish 80:80 \
  --publish 443:443 \
  --volume /etc/nginx/certs \
  --volume /etc/nginx/vhost.d \
  --volume /usr/share/nginx/html \
  --volume /var/run/docker.sock:/tmp/docker.sock:ro \
  jwilder/nginx-proxy
```

This will make sure that `nginx-proxy` is running and listening on port 80 and 443. Next we start the `letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion` container, which handles the SSL stuff for us, whenever we run a new application. Update the `DEFAULT_EMAIL` to your own email.

```bash
docker run --detach \
  --name nginx-proxy-letsencrypt \
  --volumes-from nginx-proxy \
  --volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro \
  --volume /etc/acme.sh \
  --env "DEFAULT_EMAIL=mail@yourdomain.tld" \
  jrcs/letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion
```

Now we're set up. All we have to do now is run any container we want, and pass our desired subdomain via `--env` variables.

Lets run a demo nginx container

```bash
docker run --detach \
  --name your-proxied-app \
  --env "VIRTUAL_HOST=subdomain.yourdomain.tld" \
  --env "LETSENCRYPT_HOST=subdomain.yourdomain.tld" \
  nginx
```

Your application should now be available via the subdomain with a valid SSL certificate.
