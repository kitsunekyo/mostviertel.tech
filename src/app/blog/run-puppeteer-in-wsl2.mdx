When I was playing around with puppeteer in wsl2 it wouldnt run at all. What was missing were some required dependencies in my ubuntu distribution.

```bash
sudo apt install libnss3-dev libgdk-pixbuf2.0-dev libgtk-3-dev libxss-dev
```

after installing these dependencies in wsl2 puppeteer would run just fine.

Here's a demo script i used to check.

```javascript
const puppeteer = require("puppeteer");

(async () => {
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
  console.log(await browser.version());
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto("https://google.com");
  await page.screenshot({ path: "google.png" });
  await browser.close();
})();
```
