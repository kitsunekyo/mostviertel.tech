# NextJS App Router PWA Guide

For my non-profit project I've been building a pwa with nextjs app router. The journey so far has been full of frustration and banging my head against the wall. I hope this collection of learnings will help you avoid some of the pitfalls I encountered.

I'll try to update this page, whenever I stumble upon something new. So make sure to come back periodically.

## Getting `apple-touch-startup-image` to work on iOS

This one was a real pain. Not only do you have to supply the exact dimensions of images for EVERY SINGLE iOS device, but you also have to make sure the `metadata` config is correct. Apple seems to ignore the `metadata.json` file for the most part. Because #apple.

Here's what worked for me:

I've generated the images automatically with [https://progressier.com/pwa-icons-and-ios-splash-screen-generator](https://progressier.com/pwa-icons-and-ios-splash-screen-generator)

Extract the resulting files to `public/pwa/ios/splash_screens/`. The tool generates a `txt` file with the meta tags, but nextjs wants the metatags as `metadata` config in your root layout.

I've done this with some vscode multicursor magic.

```tsx
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: "THL Praktika",

      },
    ],
  },
  other: {
    "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes",
  },
};
```

**Important**

The thing that almost broke me was the fact that none of this will work unless you add the `"mobile-web-app-capable": "yes"` to the `other` field.

## Service Worker with `serwist`

Last time i checked, `next-pwa` did not support app router. So I had to use `@serwist/next` and `serwist` instead.

Following the getting started guide on [https://serwist.pages.dev/docs/next/getting-started](https://serwist.pages.dev/docs/next/getting-started) worked for me out of the box.

Here's my `app/sw.ts` file for reference.

```ts
import { defaultCache } from "@serwist/next/worker";
import type { PrecacheEntry, SerwistGlobalConfig } from "serwist";
import { Serwist } from "serwist";

declare global {
  interface WorkerGlobalScope extends SerwistGlobalConfig {
    __SW_MANIFEST: (PrecacheEntry | string)[] | undefined;
  }
}

declare const self: ServiceWorkerGlobalScope;

const serwist = new Serwist({
  precacheEntries: self.__SW_MANIFEST,
  skipWaiting: true,
  clientsClaim: true,
  navigationPreload: true,
  runtimeCaching: defaultCache,
});

serwist.addEventListeners();
```

And here's an excerpt of my `next.config.mjs` for reference.

```ts
import withSerwistInit from "@serwist/next";

// ... other stuff like sentry, mdx, ...

const withPWA = withSerwistInit({
  swSrc: "src/app/sw.ts",
  swDest: "public/sw.js",
  disable: process.env.NODE_ENV === "development",
});

export default withPWA(nextConfig);
```
