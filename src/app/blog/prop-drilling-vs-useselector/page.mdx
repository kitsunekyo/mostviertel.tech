A fews days ago i found a reddit thread where people posted about "bad habits of react developers".
"Prop drilling" was mentioned a few times, which reminded me of a problem I just recently came across at work: overusing `useSelector` to avoid prop drilling.

For some reason react devs are really scared of prop-drilling. They reach for `useSelector` too often and too carelessly, without thinking of the negative impact on their codebase.

> Prop-drilling is a practice where you pass a data from one component to another, further down the component-tree.

I've set up a tiny react-typescript + redux example in codesandbox, that allows you to log in and visit a `UserPage` when logged in.
The code in `App.tsx` and `AppNoProps.tsx` is functionally identical. `AppNoProps.tsx` is using `useSelector` over prop drilling and I'll walk you through why I prefer the implementation of `App.tsx`.

Lets dive into `AppNoProps.tsx`.

If we hover over `user` in `const user = useSelector(...)` in either `App` or `UserPage` we see that it is typed `User | null`. This is the case whenever we use `useSelector`.

But in `<App>` we only render `<AuthenticatedApp>` and its child `<UserPage>` if `user` is NOT `null` (truthy).

```jsx
export function App() {
  const user = useSelector((state: RootState) => state.user.value);

  return (
    <div className="App">
      {user ? <AuthenticatedApp /> : <UnauthenticatedApp />}
    </div>
  );
}
```

Even though `<UserPage>` is only rendered if `user` is not `null`, we have to do null-checks all over again in `<UserPage>`. The fact that we already checked `user` for `null` in `<App>` does not help us at all.

Whenever we want to access the value of `user` we have to check for `null` again. That means adding `if` conditionals in every hook, and the `return` of our component.

```jsx
function UserPage() {
  const dispatch = useDispatch();
  const user = useSelector((state: RootState) => state.user.value); // User | null

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!user) return; // üí© we have to handle the nullable user, -> rules of hooks
    // do some react-external stuff with user
  }, [user]);

  // üí© we know that user wont be null here, but we still have to handle it
  if (!user) {
    return null;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>hello {user.name}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch(logout())}>logout</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

> Please dont use a type assertion like `const user = useSelector(...) as User` as this just overrides/disables type checking.

In our small example, a few `if` statements might not look like much of a problem, but dont forget that we have to repeat these checks for any children of `<UserPage>` too. All the redundant `if` statements and optional chaining increase our cyclomatic complexity and make the flow of our code hard to follow.

## so whats the alternative?

In `<App>` we already know for sure that user is either `null` or `User`, so by checking whether `user` is null, we can narrow its type further down the component tree. All we need to change is pass `user` down the subtree of `<AuthenticatedApp>`.

```jsx
export function App() {
  const user = useSelector((state: RootState) => state.user.value);

  return (
    <div className="App">
      {user ? <AuthenticatedApp user={user} /> : <UnauthenticatedApp />}
    </div>
  );
}
```

Hover over the `user` value in `<AuthenticatedApp user={user} />` and notice how it is typed as `User`. From here on out we can lean back and trust that we have `user` available.

Here's where the only drawback comes into play. Our `<AuthenticatedApp>` needs to accept an additional `user` prop, even though it doesnt do anything with it except passing it on to `<UserProp>`.

Lets check out `<UserPage>` and see what we've gained:

```jsx
function UserPage({ user }: { user: User }) {
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  useEffect(() => {
    // do some react-external stuff with user
    // üëç no null-checks needed
  }, [user]);

  // üëç only one return path
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>hello {user.name}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch(logout())}>logout</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

No more null checks! Our `useEffect` can run without any `if` statements and we dont need an early return if `user` is null either. We have basically eliminated any need for null checks or optional chaining for the whole component tree below `AuthenticatedApp`.

tldr: Use `useSelector` to select state from the store at the highest point you need it, narrow its type to remove `null` as possible value and pass it down as prop. Its basically "lifting state up" but for redux.

Depending on the distance between where you first need the `user` and the last leaf node where you also need the user, you might not prop-drill all the way. Lets say our App were more deeply nested like `App > AuthenticatedApp > Layout > SubLayout > UserPage > UserSettingsPage > UserForm`. In this case I might not prop-drill the `user` value from `<App>` all the way down to UserForm. Instead I would decide whats the closest ancestor of `<UserForm>` that needs `user` and user a combination of prop-drilling and composition from there. Here the closest ancestor would probably be `<UserPage>`. That way I dont need to drill through `<Layout>` and `<SubLayout>`, but I still reduce the number of null-checks in the `<UserPage>` tree.

In development any "best practice" or "antipattern" come with tradeoffs, so it is on us to weigh the pros and cons and decide what works better for us.

That said, I would pick simple, readable code over loads of `if`s and optional chaining any time, even if it means adding a few more props to components.
