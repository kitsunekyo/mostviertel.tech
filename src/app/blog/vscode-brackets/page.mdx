> Do you use an extension to colorize matching brackets? You don't need to. VSCode now has this feature built in.

## Colorized Brackets

By default all our brackets are gray. So its takes some mental overhead to find bracket pairs.

To enable the setting, open your vscode settings (<kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> and type _Preferences: Open Settings (UI)_)
Search for "Bracket Pair" and enable the setting below.

> json settings: `"editor.bracketPairColorization.enabled": true,`

Matching brackets will now be rendered in matching colors.

## Bracket Guides

But we dont have to stop there. When we're in a deeply nested structure, its not always easy to find in which block you currently are. VCode has a feature for that as well.

Open the same settings page back up again, and set "Show Bracket Guides" to `active`. You can have both vertical and horizontal Guides.

> json settings: `"editor.guides.bracketPairs": "active"`

In your javascript code, you will now see a colored vertical line, indicating in which block you currently are with your cursor (yellow in the screenshot).
