<TextSection title="Who Am I?">
  <p>
    Imagine - A software engineer with a solid decade of experience bringing his
    strong foundation in communications, design and usability to not just the
    frontend, but also to API design and developer relations.
  </p>
  <p>
    While my focus over the last ten years has been frontend, I have applied my
    skills to api design, cloud infrastructure, tooling and more.

<TextSection title="How Do I Work?">
  <p>
    The last ten years in the industry have shown me, that dev teams build
    better products if they love what they do. Exceptional performance and
    growth is only possible when we find joy and purpose in our work. So I'm
    bringing my curiosity and joy for web technologies into all my teams.
  </p>
  <p>
    Building bridges to other teams and establishing common goals helps us get
    stuff done as a collective.

<TextSection title="What Else?">
  <p>
    Since 2023, I train to become a certified wholistic dog trainer, so that I
    can improve life with our canine companions. For that reason I'm working
    part-time until the education is completed in May 2025.
  </p>
  <p>
    The rest of my day is spent shooting arrows, making music and endulging in
    pc gaming.
